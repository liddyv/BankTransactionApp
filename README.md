# BankTransactionApp
A Bank Transaction System For A Regional Bank

User Story

A regional rural bank CEO wants to modernize banking experience for his customers by
providing a computer solution for them to post the bank transactions in their savings and
checking accounts from the comfort of their home. He has a vision of a system, which begins by
displaying the starting balances for checking and savings account for a customer. The application
first prompts the user to enter the information for a transaction, including whether a withdrawal or
deposit is to be made, whether the transaction will be posted to the checking or savings account,
and the amount of the transaction. When the user (customer) finishes deposits and withdrawals,
the application displays the fees and payments for the month followed by the final balances for
the moth. The application needs to be friendly and it needs to validate the user entries.
